                        <p>I am currently a student at Roseland University Prep in Santa Rosa, Ca and basketball is a major part of my life! My favorite NBA team is the warriors but my favorite player of all time is Muggsy Bogues. He was amazing! He is the shortest player to ever play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with his height of 5'3". Thoughout his life he went through much criticism which all started on the basketball courts. Then many doubted that he would every succeed with the pro's. He he best known for playing with the charlotte Hornets even though he has played with the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors. Bogues played point guard for his 14 season career and then later became a WNBA coach for Charlotte Sting. I look uo to Muggsy Bogues because he demostrates that anything is possible. His story connects to my life and how I want to play basketball at a professional level but have a disadvantage because of my height.</p>
